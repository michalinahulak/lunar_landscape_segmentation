# Lunar Landscape Image Segmentation
The "Lunar Landscape Segmentation" project focuses on the segmentation of lunar landscape images. The main objective of the project is to develop a segmentation model that can automatically identify and extract different elements in lunar images. 3 (technically 4) classes are considered: large rocks (in blue), smaller rocks (in green), the sky (in red) (and everything else, in black).

# Application
Segmenting lunar landscape images has various potential applications. It can assist scientists and researchers in geological analysis of the lunar surface, identifying potential landing sites for future space missions, studying topographic and geological changes, and exploring the evolution of the lunar surface over time.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project was obtained from a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/romainpessia/artificial-lunar-rocky-landscape-dataset). It contains a total of 9,766 realistic renders of rocky lunar landscapes, along with their corresponding segmented images. The segmentation task involves classifying three classes: the sky, smaller rocks, and larger rocks. Additionally, the dataset includes a table of bounding boxes for all the larger rocks and processed, cleaned-up ground truth images. This comprehensive dataset serves as a valuable resource for training and evaluating models in lunar landscape segmentation tasks.

# How to run?
To run the model, you need to download the file and run in Jupyter Notebook or open it using Google Colaboratory.

# Project status
in progress
